## In Java, We must define a class, and we must define a method
```
class Hello { 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
 // The method body will go here.
  System.out.println(7 + 5);
 }
}
```

## Declaration & Assignment
`int i = 42;`

we will have error if we:
1. did not declare a variable
2. declare variable to the wrong type
3. declare a variable to a type that already exists


## Reference Type and Primitive Type

Type String is a reference type. This is like what you are used to from Python. A Java variable cannot hold a String value directly inside itself; it can only hold a reference to an object of type String. But type int is a primitive type. 
A Java variable can hold an int value directly inside itself.
